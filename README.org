* Git FastForward
To Fast Forward one's git practice and knowledge use these tools:

** Use good command line extra's

  - [[http://www.github.com/tj/git-extras][git-extras]] - made by TJ Hollowaychuk of JS and Go fame.
    - a lot of extra super helpful git command line functions
    - git delete-branch for example, is super useful. It allows quick and easy removal of local AND remote branches (whether they be on github or bitbucket)
  - tig - a command line git client. Nice to visualize the branching of various development branches.

** Use good git visualization tools

*** Cross platform
  - smartgit
  - [[https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/][smartgit]]
  - [[https://github.com/alberthier/git-webui][git-webui]]
  - ungit (requires node js)
  - gitkraken
  - sourcetree

*** Mac
  - gitx by rowanj on github *
  - gitup
  - tower2

*** Linux
  - git giggle

*** Unix / Linux (i.e. mac and linux)
  - tig
  - not git per se but super useful on the bash prompt to quickly discover the git status and branch status
    - https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt

*** Editor Based
  - Magit (emacs)
  - Fugitive (vim)
  - Git gutter (used by similar various names in Emacs, Vim, Atom, and Sublime -- shows on the sidebar the areas of text that have been modified)

** Also git best practice
